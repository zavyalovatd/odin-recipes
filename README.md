We are bulding a basic recipe website!
I intend to use this file as a way of self-reflection.

Alright! I am done, there are a number of questions/ideas:
1. how to make an image not part of  the text?
2. clearly image sizes whould all be aligned 
3. the first page is mighty empty
4. i forgot i need to push the project to github
5. maybe an image folder would have been best but oh well
